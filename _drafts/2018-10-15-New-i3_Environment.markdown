I spent some time tweaking a new install of i3 on Manjaro Linux in recent days. It isn't entirely finished yet, but I quite like it regardless. Color scheme is based off of the wallpaper I found somewhere online that depict The Hulk versus Wolverine.

This is the i3 [config](https://github.com/murfman/conf_files/blob/master/config/.i3/config) file that I am using.
