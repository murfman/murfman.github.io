I'm a fulltime divorced nerd with three kids. I also am part of a podcast about the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game called [The Miskatonic University Podcast](http://www.mu-podcast.com/), see I told you I was a nerd. This is a spot I'll start using to house more and more scripts and such as time passes.
