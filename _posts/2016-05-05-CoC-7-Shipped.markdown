I finally got my shipping notification for the new Call of Cthulhu 7th ed. Kickstarter! The thing should be here within the next few days and I am so bloody excited! In case you don't know the Kickstarter ended back in 2013, and the parent company Chaosium has had some major shake-ups in the last couple of years; all of which made this release seem almost unfathomable.

But somehow the guys at Chaosium and Moon Design have finally delivered! I've been seeing photos showing up on the interwebs in the last few days with people showing off their copies, and its been driving me nutty. My good friend Nigel in the UK even got his in!

But mine is now coming and I can't wait for it any longer!
