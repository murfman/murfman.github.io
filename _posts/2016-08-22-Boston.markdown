Last week I had to travel to Boston for work and help MassDOT with using our system for over-dimensional truck permitting. Over all it was a great trip, even though I did have to be up at 5am EST everyday last week. But even with that looming over me each day I managed to get out and see some of the sites. Unfortunately my phone died a few times later into the night thanks to the long work days, so not many pictures were taken. But I did get to see the Boston Public Library and the John Singer Sargent murals there, I made it to Chinatown, the Northend, the Westend, Newbury Street, I took a duck tour, and ate some fantastic food. On Wednesday, my friend Chad from NYC surprised me and showed up in Boston on his way to New Hampshire as well.
